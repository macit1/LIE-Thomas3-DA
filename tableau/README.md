Tableau is an amazing platform for seeing, understanding, and making key decisions based on your data! With it, you will be able to carry out incredible data discovery, analysis, and storytelling.

Tableau was founded in 2003 as a result of a computer science project at Stanford that aimed to improve the flow of analysis and make data more accessible to people through visualization.


## Tableau Public
[Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) is a free tool that has almost all of the same functionality as Tableau Desktop (Personal). You can currently connect to and explore Excel, text files, and Google Sheets with up to 15 million rows.


The only catch with Tableau Public is that your files have to be saved to the web, and external audiences can potentially find your work. For this reason, **it is not a suitable option for private business data (or company use cases with sensitive data ).**

## Important note:
As we are learning, we will use Tableau Public as our main tool. However, for use cases, we recommend using the [14-day free trial](https://www.tableau.com/products/trial). Read more: [Tableau Public vs. Tableau Desktop](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tableau-public-vs-tableau-desktop/).

## Get Started

To start using Tableau you must:
1. Create a free account on the Tableau Public [website](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover).
2. Download the [desktop version](https://www.tableau.com/products/public/download).

This will let you create interactive graphs, stunning maps, and live dashboards in minutes. 
In this free version, you can save your work by publishing it to your Tableau Public profile, and share it anywhere on the web.

You can  also use Tableau directly from your browser but we recommend using it in your laptop.
