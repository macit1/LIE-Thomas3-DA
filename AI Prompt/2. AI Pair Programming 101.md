# AI Pair Programming 101

Pair programming used to be two people sitting physically next to each other, writing code together. Or all by yourself, debugging by talking to a [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). Time has moved on. These days, and probably even more so in the future, pair programming is conceived as yourself programming with a _virtual_ code assistant. It will become an inevitable part of a modern programmer's workflow.

This brief lesson dives into how to set up and interact with such a virtual assistant, the power and dangers of using one, and a couple of general tips and tricks.

## Tools

Let's dive straight into it. These are currently the most important virtual code assistants (also called **AI pair programmers**) out there:

- **ChatGPT** aka the mother of all, the handyman, the mainstream popstar
- **GitHub Copilot**
- **Amazon CodeWhisperer**

The assistants rely on a large language model trained on billions of lines of code from various programming languages, Git commits, notebooks, comments, and other useful artifacts. An example of a core model for code is [StarCoder](https://huggingface.co/blog/starcoder) from Hugging Face, or [Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex) from OpenAI.

AI is moving fast, and so are the many products based on it. Expect to come across alternative assistants, but don't yet be too bothered by them. Everything looks shiny and cool on the onset, but it might not always be worth your time. For now, we suggest to pick a tool you want to use, and become best friends with it.

We present the three options in what follow. First we go over the main uses of AI-driven code assistence.

## Applications

AI is a great enabler of many things, but also of itself. The core principle is therefore simple: **use AI to write AI**. There are a few more concrete use cases.

### Use case #1: Generation of boilerplate code 
The main use case of AI pair programming is to very quickly build out boilerplate code. These are portions of code that are cumbersome to write or copy-paste, and are for that reason a drag on developer productivity. Having this boilerplate code almost automatically generated, allows you to focus on the more specific code sections.

### Use case #2: Debugging
Much like rubber ducks, virtual pair programmers can be a great help when your are stuck. You can simply hand over your buggy code, and ask to propose a fix. You will likely receive an answer about what is wrong with your code, and an _explanation_ as to why. In some cases, this one-to-one interaction is more efficient than having to scroll through Google's search results.

### Use case #3: Code translation
It might happen that you need to migrate your codebase from one programming language to another. That is a very tedious task, and not the most fun. Pair programmers can help you out, but you will need to be extra careful testing if the conversion didn't accidentally add any unwanted behavior.

### Use case #4: Kickstart learning
Another use case is learning. Switching from one programming language to another means getting acquainted with a different syntax from scratch. Even though it typically only takes a few days for experienced developers, being able to start with actual challenges or problems is helpful.

### Important caveats!
A couple of caveats, though. You remain the end responsible of the code. If the AI assistant is wrong, it means _you_ are wrong, so don't blame the assistant! Do not be fooled by the confidence of the suggestions.

You always need to check, reformat, restructure, and integrate into the whole codebase whatever snippet your pair programmer gives you. You will have to refactor the code most likely yourself. Prompt it, write it, format it, lint it!

Relying solely on an AI pair programmer inhibits deep learning. Not the statistical deep learning, but the actual internalizing of new concepts. Be aware of this as you are studying something new you really want to grasp. For the things you don't necessarily want to master, or those you already properly understand, feel free to automate as much as possible.

## Run-through

This section presents a short overview of the dynamics behind the three abovementioned tools. Fortunately, the key principles are very similar, so you will be able to switch among the tools easily if needed.

### ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a general-purpose tool, with capacities going way beyond debugging or writing code. In a chat-like window, you can ask questions back and forth until you obtain a satisfying answer. The pair programming for this tool happens outside of your code environment.

The ChatGPT portal is available [here](https://openai.com/chatgpt). There are a lot of Visual Studio Code extensions available, but be careful which one you select.

Here is a [datacamp course](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers) focused on prompt engineering for developpers.

This is a written [tutorial](https://realpython.com/chatgpt-coding-mentor-python) about using ChatGPT for Python programming.

### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot in the broad sense is a utility that communicates with the **OpenAI Codex** model under the hood, a model pretrained on huge amounts of code. There is a more advanced version coming up, **GitHub Copilot X** - read about it [here](https://github.com/features/preview/copilot-x).

Visual Studio Code offers two main extensions:
- **GitHub Copilot Labs** is used to _translate_ code from one programming language to another. It can also be used to _explain_ code.
- **GitHub Copilot (Nightly)** is used to build out code step by step, by iteratively tuning prompts. The nightly build contains newer, more experimental (maybe less well tested) changes.

Some more info about getting started with the extensions is found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/artificial-intelligence).

***Pro Tip*** | The extensions are also available in GitHub Codespaces. You can add them to `devcontainer.json` so it is always part of your environment.

How to use it once the extensions are enabled? Put a prompt explaining what you want to achieve behind `# prompt` or between `### prompt ###`. It will start autocompleting right away. The suggested code will be generated afterwards, and can cover multiple lines or functions.

You can also start typing code, and after holding on for a second, it will suggest a completion. Code as such will thus also be autocompleted. Try typing `fruits =` and it will suggest a couple of fruits in a `list`. Copilot learns from your own codebase, i.e. the context you are working in, in real time.

Don't hesitate to intervene by giving an example or by rewriting the prompt while the AI is suggesting code.

### Amazon CodeWhisperer

AWS CodeWhisperer was launched in beta a bit later than GitHub CoPilot, so it might be slightly behind on the curve in terms of effectiveness. It is more tightly coupled with AWS, so when you are developing in the AWS cloud, this is most likely your preferred choice. However, you do not need to have an AWS account or use AWS at all, meaning you are free to use it wherever you want.

It works in a fairly similar fashion as GitHub Copilot. It does seem you need to take charge more, by guiding the process and suggesting and "accepting" code in a more step-by-step approach. Some argue it is a bit slower, but it still does a good job and tends to write cleaner code.

A nice feature is that CodeWhisperer can also scan your code to highlight and define security issues.

To set up AWS CodeWhisperer in VS Code, see this [guide and short video](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/whisper-setup-indv-devs.html). A good related blog post is found [here](https://kodekloud.com/blog/aws-codewhisperer).
